# Raft
[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/pgte/skiff?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Node.js implementation of the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](http://raftconsensus.github.io/).

## Install

```bash
$ node install node-raft --save
```

## Require

```javascript
var Node = require('node-raft');
```

## Create a node

```javascript
var node = Node();
```

or, with options:

```javascript
options = {
  // ...
};
var node = Node(options);
```

### Node create options

* `id`: id of the node. if not defined, it's self assigned. accessible on `node.id`
* `cluster`: the id of the cluster this node will be a part of
* `transport`: the transport to communicate with peers. See the [transport API](#transport-provider-api)
* `persistence`: the node persistence layer. See the [persistence API](#persistence-provider-api)
* `uuid`: function that generates a UUID. Defaults to using the [`cuid`](https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid) package.
* `heartbeatInterval`: the interval between heartbeats sent from leader. defaults to 50 ms.
* `minElectionTimeout`: the minimum election timeout. defaults to 150 ms.
* `maxElectionTimeout`: the maximum election timeout. defaults to 300 ms.


### Node API

#### .join()

Joins a peer.

```javascript
node.join(peer);
```

The peer is a string describing the peer. The description depends on the transport you're using.

#### .peers

An array containing all the known peers.


#### .command(command, callback)

Appends a command to the leader log. If node is not the leader, callback gets invoked with an error. Example:

```javascript
node.command('some command', function(err) {
  if (err) {
    if (err.code == 'ENOTLEADER') {
       // redirect client to err.leader
    }
  } else {
    console.log('cluster agreed on this command');
  }
});
```


#### Events

A node emits the following events that may or not be interesting to you:

* `error(error)` - when an unexpected error occurs.
* `state(stateName)` - when a new state transition occurs. Possible values for `stateName` are: `idle`, `follower`, `candidate`, `leader`.
* `loaded()` - when a node has loaded configuration from persistence provider.
* `election timeout()` - when an election timeout occurs.
* `applied log(logIndex)` - when a node applies a log entry to the state machine


### Transport provider API

The node `transport` option accepts a provider object that implements the following interface:

* `connect(options)` — for connecting to the peer. returns a connection object

#### Connection API

The connection API implements the following interface:

* `invoke(type, arguments, callback)` — for making a remote call into the peer. The `callback` argument is a function with the signature `function (err, result)`.
* `listen(callback)` — listen for messages from the remote peer. The `callback` argument is a function with the signature `function (type, args, cb)`. `cb` is a function that accepts the reply arguments.
* `close(callback)` — for closing the connection. The `callback` argument is a function with the signature `function (err)`.


### Persistence provider API

The node `persistence` option accepts a provider object that implements the following interface:

* `saveMeta(nodeId, state, callback)` — saves the raft engine metadata. `nodeId` is a string that represents the current node. `state` is an arbitrary object (hash map) and `callback` is a function with the signature `function callback(err)`;
* `loadMeta(nodeId, callback)` — loads the engine metadata state. `callback` is a function with the signature `function callback(err, state)`;
* `applyLog(nodeId, commitIndex, logEntry, callback)` - applies a log entry to the node state machine.
  * Persistence layer should save the commitIndex if it wants to make sure that log entries are not repeated.
  * Saving this should be atomic: the `commitIndex` and the log application to the state machine should be successful or fail entirely.
  * If the commitIndex has already been applied in the past, just callback with success.
  `callback` is a function with the following signature: `function callback(err)`.
* `lastAppliedCommitIndex(nodeId, callback)` - returns the last `commitIndex` that was successfully applied to the node state machine.
  * is asynchronous: `callback` is a function invoked once the result is ready
  * `callback` is a function with the following signature: `function(err, commitIndex)` - if operation resulted in error, `err` contains an error object. Otherwise, `commitIndex` may contain an integer with the index of the latest applied `commitIndex` if there was one.
